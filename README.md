# Robotic Kinematics - Project

This is one of my ongoing univeristy projects.
The original version is made using MATLAB, but I wanted to make it easier to run using Python.
I'm modeling an industrial robot with 6DoF.
This project splits into four phasis:
 - Kinematics in MATLAB
 - Dynamics in MATLAB
 - Control in MATLAB
 - Design in CATIA V5 of the robot

I will rewrite the MATLAB scripts in Python and add to this repository as the progress comes through!
Once the entire project is completed, I will also add the MATLAB scripts in this repository.

Also if you would like to try out the scripts, they can work on their own without the main.py scirpt
