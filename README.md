# Robotic Kinematics - Project

This is one of my ongoing univeristy projects.
The original version is made using MATLAB, but I wanted to make it easier to run using Python.
This project splits into three phasis:
 - Kinematics in MATLAB
 - Control in MATLAB
 - Design in CATIA V5 of the robot

I will rewrite the MATLAB scripts in Python and add to this repository as the progress comes through!

Also if you would like to try out the scripts, they can work on their own without the main.py scirpt
